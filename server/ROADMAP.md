# AI Association Game Roadmap

This document outlines the planned features and improvements for the AI Association Game project. Items are organized by priority and expected impact.

## High Priority

### Performance & Cost Optimization
- [ ] **Smart Caching System**: Implement a persistent cache using Redis or MongoDB to maintain associations between server restarts
- [ ] **Batch Association Processing**: Pre-generate associations for commonly used words and store them in the database
- [ ] **Adaptive Token Limits**: Dynamically adjust max_tokens based on response patterns to further optimize API costs
- [ ] **Word Embedding Integration**: Use pre-trained word vectors to supplement AI associations and reduce API calls

### User Experience
- [ ] **User Accounts**: Allow players to create accounts to track their progress and statistics
- [ ] **Daily Challenges**: Fixed daily puzzles for all players with leaderboards
- [ ] **Difficulty Settings**: Let players choose difficulty levels
- [ ] **Mobile-Friendly UI**: Improve responsive design for better mobile experience
- [ ] **Accessibility Improvements**: Ensure game is fully accessible following WCAG guidelines

### Infrastructure
- [ ] **Database Integration**: Fully implement MongoDB for persistent storage of games, stats, and user data
- [ ] **Testing Suite**: Add comprehensive unit and integration tests
- [ ] **CI/CD Pipeline**: Set up automated testing and deployment

## Medium Priority

### Gameplay Features
- [ ] **Custom Puzzles**: Allow users to create and share their own word association puzzles
- [ ] **Multiple Game Modes**: Add timed challenges, endless mode, and themed collections
- [ ] **Multiplayer Mode**: Add head-to-head competitions between players
- [ ] **Achievement System**: Reward players for various accomplishments
- [ ] **Progressive Difficulty**: As players improve, gradually increase the difficulty of puzzles

### Analytics & Insights
- [ ] **Enhanced Admin Dashboard**: Add more detailed statistics and visualizations
- [ ] **User Behavior Analytics**: Track common paths and challenging connections to improve game design
- [ ] **Performance Monitoring**: Better logging and monitoring of server performance
- [ ] **A/B Testing Framework**: Test different game mechanics to optimize engagement
- [ ] **User Feedback System**: Add reporting mechanism for biased, inappropriate, or confusing word associations

### Technical Improvements
- [ ] **API Rate Limiting Improvement**: More granular rate limiting based on user authentication
- [ ] **WebSocket Integration**: Real-time updates for multiplayer features
- [ ] **Service Worker**: Enable offline gameplay for previously cached puzzles
- [ ] **Module Refactoring**: Break monolithic server into smaller, more maintainable modules

## Low Priority

### Extended Features
- [ ] **Social Sharing**: Add ability to share results and challenge friends
- [ ] **Visual Representations**: Show word connections as an interactive graph
- [ ] **Alternative AI Models**: Support additional models beyond Claude (e.g., OpenAI, Mistral, local models)
- [ ] **Internationalization**: Support for multiple languages
- [ ] **Theme Customization**: Allow users to customize UI themes and appearance

### Community Building
- [ ] **Public API**: Create a documented API for third-party integrations
- [ ] **Developer Documentation**: Comprehensive docs for contributors
- [ ] **Browser Extension**: Create a browser extension version of the game
- [ ] **Educational Mode**: Add features specifically for classroom use

## Technical Debt & Maintenance

- [ ] **Code Cleanup**: Remove unused variables and functions (e.g., 'regenerating' in App.js)
- [ ] **React Best Practices**: Update React code to use more modern patterns (hooks, context)
- [ ] **Documentation**: Add JSDoc comments throughout the codebase
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Improve error logging and recovery
- [ ] **Security Audit**: Conduct thorough review of authentication and authorization mechanisms

## Long-term Vision

- [ ] **AI Association API Service**: Develop the word association system into a standalone API service
- [ ] **Educational Applications**: Create specialized versions for vocabulary building and language learning
- [ ] **Research Partnerships**: Collaborate with linguistic researchers to improve association quality
- [ ] **Native Mobile Apps**: Develop dedicated iOS and Android applications
- [ ] **Enterprise Edition**: Create a version customized for corporate training and team building

## Contribution Guidelines

If you're interested in contributing to any of these roadmap items, please:

1. Check the issue tracker to see if the feature is already being worked on
2. Create a new issue describing your implementation plan if one doesn't exist
3. Wait for feedback from maintainers before starting work
4. Follow the coding standards and testing requirements outlined in CONTRIBUTING.md

This roadmap is a living document and will be updated regularly based on user feedback and project priorities.
