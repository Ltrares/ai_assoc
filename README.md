# Word Association Game

A web application that challenges players to find a path between two words using word associations, powered by Claude AI.

## How the Game Works

1. Each day has a new starting word and target word generated by Claude AI.
2. Players see a set of words associated with the current word.
3. By selecting associated words, players try to create a path to the target word.
4. The "Go Back" button allows players to return to the previous word if they want to try a different path.
5. The scoring system tracks three metrics:
   - **Path Length**: Number of words in the final solution path
   - **Back Steps**: Number of times the player went back to try different paths
   - **Total Moves**: Path length + back steps = total number of moves made
6. Game stats show averages across all players to compare your performance.

## Project Structure

- `/client` - React frontend 
- `/server` - Express backend API with Claude integration

## AI Features

- **Word Association Generation**: Claude AI generates contextually relevant word associations
- **Dynamic Daily Games**: New word pairs are automatically generated each day
- **Intelligent Word Paths**: Start and target words are chosen to require multiple steps of association

## Getting Started

### API Key Setup

1. Get an API key from [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/)
2. Copy it to the `.env` file in the server directory

### Backend

```bash
cd server
npm install
npm run dev
```

Server will run on http://localhost:5050

### Frontend

```bash
cd client
npm install
npm start
```

Frontend will run on http://localhost:3000

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, Anthropic Claude API
- **Frontend**: React
- **Database**: MongoDB (optional, currently using in-memory data)

## Admin Features

Generate a new game immediately by making a POST request to `/api/admin/generate-game` with the proper admin token. In development mode, no auth is required.

## Future Enhancements

- User accounts to track personal records
- Daily challenges with leaderboards
- Custom games where users can set the start and target words
- Difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard)
- Hint system for players who get stuck
